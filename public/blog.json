  "description": "CORS stands for cross-origin resource sharing. Just like HTTPS, it's a protocol that defines some rules for sharing resources from a different origin. We know that modern web apps consist of two key components: a client and a server. The client requests some data from the server, and the server sends back data as a response."

  "name": "How does the private route work?",
  "description": "Private Routes require a user being authorized to visit a route. So if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot access it. The most common example is authentication where a user can only access the protected pages when they are authorized (which means in this case being authenticated). Authorization goes beyond authentication though. For example, a user can also have roles and permissions which give a user access to specific areas of the application."

  "name": "What is Node? How does Node work?",
  "description": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime used to create scalable server-side and networking applications via virtual private servers. It was settled long back by multi-threading, empowering us to have different ‘strings’ on an individual CPU. In this way, to clear up, on the off chance that you have ten strings running on, a CPU scheduler will part up the CPU’s time equitably among every one of them, so they involve break even with time cuts."
